## How to Run the Test Script

1. **Setup Directories:**  
   Ensure that:
   - Your source files are located in the `myfiles` directory.
   - The destination `uploads` directory exists (the script will create it if not).

2. **Update Paths (if necessary):**  
   Modify the paths in the script (`source_dir` and `dest_dir`) to match your local setup.

3. **Run the Script:**  
   Execute the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python upload_test.py
