COCOMO Analysis Report for Primary School Homework Portal
========================================================

COCOMO Model Explanation:
------------------------
The Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO) is a procedural software cost estimation model.
This analysis uses the Basic COCOMO model for organic mode projects.
The formula used is: Effort = 2.4 * (KLOC)^1.05
where KLOC is thousands of lines of code and Effort is in person-months.

Lines of Code Breakdown:
----------------------
Backend (Node.js/Express): 1,160 lines
Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS): 9,310 lines
Database (SQL): 0 lines

Total Metrics:
-------------
Total Lines of Code: 10,470
KLOC (Thousands of Lines of Code): 10.47
Estimated Effort: 28.26 person-months

Note: This estimation assumes:
- Organic mode (relatively small team, good development environment)
- Familiar development environment
- Medium project constraints
